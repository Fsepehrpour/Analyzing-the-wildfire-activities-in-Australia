# Analyzing-the-wildfire-activities-in-Australia
This practice aims to analyze and visualize the wildfire activities in Australia using the provided dataset. I will explore patterns and trends, and create visualizations to gain insights into the behavior of wildfires in different regions of Australia.

I will create visualizations in this repo using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Folium.

# Tasks to be performed
TASK 1.1: To understand changes in average estimated fire area over time using pandas to plot the line chart.
TASK 1.2 To plot the estimated fire area over a month
TASK 1.3 Use the functionality of seaborn to develop a barplot, to find the insights on the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness across the regions
TASK 1.4 Develop a pie chart and find the portion of count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires vary across regions
TASK 1.5 Customize the previous pie plot for a better visual representation
TASK 1.6 Use Matplotlib to develop a histogram of the mean estimated fire brightness
TASK 1.7 Use the functionality of seaborn and pass region as hue, to understand the distribution of estimated fire brightness across regions
TASK 1.8 Develop a scatter plot to find the correlation between mean estimated fire radiative power and mean confidence level
TASK 1.9 Mark all seven regions affected by wildfires, on the Map of Australia using Folium

# Part 2: Dashboard to display charts based on selected Region and Year
The objective of this part is to create dashboards to contain my plots and charts.
In this regard, I will create dashboards using Dash and Plotly and then add user interactions to the dashboards.

The dashboard will display the following two charts:
-Pie Chart on Monthly Average Estimated Fire Area
-Bar Chart on Monthly Average Count of Pixels for Presumed Vegetation Fires

# Tasks to be performed
TASK 2.1 Add title to the dashboard
TASK 2.2 Add the radio items and a dropdown right below the first inner division
TASK 2.3 Add two empty divisions for output inside the next inner division
TASK 2.4 Add the Output and Input components inside the app.callback decorator
TASK 2.5 Add the callback function
